  1. Convolution
         Convulution is a process of extracting features/information from an image.
  2. Filters/Kernels
            Kernels are used to extract features from the images
  3. Epochs
          Epoch is a process of iterating an complete image 1 time. 
  4. 1x1 Convolution
          It is a convultion layer where both X and Y dimension remains the same. 
  5. 3x3 Convolution
          It is a convulution layer which reduces the AXB dimension image into (A-2)X(B-2) dimension.
  6. Feature Maps
          Output of a convultion layer. It is more like the extracted feature
  7. Activation Function
          This function decides the output which we need to be activated from neuron
  8. Receptive Field
         When dealing with high-dimensional inputs, it is not possible to connect to all neurons. Rather, connect each neuron to only a local region of the input volume.
